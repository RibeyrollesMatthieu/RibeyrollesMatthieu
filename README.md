### My friends say I'm a cat so.. **_meow, world!_** 👋🐈

I'm Matthieu, I'm a french React front-end developer 👨‍💻. I usually work with React, NextJs and Scss, but I keep learning new things!

What to tell you..? I **love ❤️** animals (especially my pets, but don't tell them, I don't want them to get overconfident), drawing, puzzles, music 🎹 and sport.
